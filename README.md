## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
version control system tracks changes to file system over time allowing people to collaborate and maintain a complete history of the project's evolution
repository-here all files and their revision history are stored
branches-this one allows developers to work on different features without affecting the main codebase
merging-here, combining changes from one branch into another occurs
commits-tracks the project at a specific point in timeand it includes all the changes made since the previous commit
Github is a tool for managing versions of code because it provides a centralised web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.
Github is commonly used because of;
its ability of version control such as tracking changes and managing branches
its ability of multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously
its ability to integrate a wide range of tools and services making it easier to incorporate version control into your development workflow.
version control help in maintaining project integrity by;
it provides a clear record of who made what changes enhancing accountability and making it easier to identify and adress issues
it also facilitate collaboration as itallows multiple users to work on the same project at the same time and merge their changes
the commit history provides detailed record of how the project has evolved over time making iteasier to understand the context and reasoning behind changes
